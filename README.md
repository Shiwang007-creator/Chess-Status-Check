# Chess-Status-Check
The Chess Status Check project determines the state of a chess game—whether it’s check, checkmate, or safe—based on the positions of the pieces. It applies logical reasoning and conditional analysis to evaluate moves and threats, enhancing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
